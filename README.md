# Space.js
Space.js is an interactive experience that allows users to travel across the solar system and view planets. Users can click on a button that allows them to select a particular planet or celestial object, and the application will perform a flyby and traverse to that planet, displaying its relevant information in a side modal.

 
## Architecture and Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript for application logic
- HTML5 Web Audio API for sound generation, processing, and control
- Three.js for rendering of planet shapes and celestial objects
- Webpack to compile and bundle assets
